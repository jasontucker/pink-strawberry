I'm Jason Tucker, by day I work as an IT director for a non-profit and on the weekends I drive for Lyft in the LA / OC markets here in California.

I started writing about #gigeconomy stuff on Facebook & twitter and later on my personal website [jasontucker.blog](https://jasontucker.blog) but found that this rideshare / gigeconomy content needed its own website. I started driving about 16 months ago.
